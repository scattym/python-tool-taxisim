# Tools for simulating taxi protocols

This tool currently implements the GWP5043 format of taxi data, notifying of fare start/end etc

It is a very simple POC based around send data over a serial connection, in the lab this is a serial over IP connection however this can be any seriaal connection

Although it's just using the python serial lib so will work directly also.
